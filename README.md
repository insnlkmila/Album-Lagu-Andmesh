# Album-Lagu-Andmesh

This project was made for visualize an album song of Andmesh. So, how do we visualize it? Through the python programming language, wordcloud module provided by Python will make it easier. Then what is the goal? The aim is to pay attention to some words that might have been overlooked by the intentions conveyed by the writer or singer. In addition, this is the second project where I have previously tried to visualize the president's speech from the [following link](https://predatech.org/wordcloud-in-python-analisis-pidato-presiden-ri/). I think it will be more interesting if I try it into a songs' album to see what words are interesting from Andmesh so that his songs dominate the charts even it was popular in the American.

What is the first step we take? Collecting data and cleaning data. You can see how the following data differ.

After the data is cleaned, it is ready to be visualized in the following form.

**Good luck, hopefully useful.**

>#maybe this is very simple but I can develop my knowledge through small things, and for those who are just learning, I think this is suitable. I am too curious and there are many limited things that I want to do, but with these small things, a common thread starts to appear on the answers I want. But I still have a lot to learn, and so will you. Stay enthusiastic and consistently learn new things
